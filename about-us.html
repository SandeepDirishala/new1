<h3>UnitedHealthcare <strong style="font-weight:bold;">Student</strong>Resources</h3>
<p>
There is no substitute for experience. <strong>Student</strong>Resources is student insurance and has been for XX years. We set the bar by which other plans are measured. We’ve really mastered all facets of student health insurance plans – from ACA-compliant plan design to innovative online administration tools. </p>

<h3>Student health insurance plan design</h3> 

<p>
The devil is in the details! We’ve literally built thousands of student insurance plans from the ground up for hundreds of colleges and universities. As diverse as your student body, our health care plans can accommodate virtually any need. 
</p>

<p>
We offer injury and sickness plans - for both domestic and international students – customized to meet your needs. Because we know that students need more, we also offer emergency medical travel services, vision and dental plans and insurance for risk groups - like study abroad and special summer programs. </p>

<h3>Student Health Insurance Plan Implementation</h3>

<p>
You only get one chance to make a great first impression, right? We make sure that school administrators, students and Student Health Center staff are included in our student health plan transition and implementation process. We review and confirm every detail of your plan, your preferences and your processes. The result is a smooth transition with clearly communicated plans and administrative processes that ease your transition to UnitedHealthcare <strong>Student</strong>Resources and provides uninterrupted benefits for your students and unparalleled service for you. </p>

<h3>Student Health Insurance Administration</h3>

<p><strong>Student</strong>Resources administration skills have been honed over decades of managing student health insurance plans. Your customized benefits are supported by our flexibility - unique Student Health Center billings, pharmacy claims, referral requirements and customized administrative reports. Although our systems are the backbone, you’ll never lose that human touch. You'll have direct access to the Claims and Customer Service representatives that evaluate your claims and talk with your students every day. </p>
<h3>Why not ask us?</h3>
<p>
We are asked to quote plan designs all the time. We’re really good at it! Why not <a style="color:#4a90e2" href="admin-request-rfp.html" >request a quote</a> for your school? We’ve got all the right stuff: flexibility, competitive rates, a ton of experience and the strength of UnitedHealthcare behind us.
