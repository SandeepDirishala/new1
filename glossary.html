										<p><span class="term">domestic partner</span> </p>
										   <p>Domestic partners are commonly defined as &quot;two adults who share
										  an emotional, physical and financial relationship similar to that of a married
										  couple but who either choose not to marry or cannot legally marry. They share
										  a mutual obligation of support for the basic necessities of life.&quot; Additionally,

										<p><span class="term">dual choice </span></p>
										   <p>Dual choice allows the employer to offer his employees not one, but
										  two health plans. Instead of picking the least expensive plan for all employees,
										  Dual Choice lets employees choose the type of plan that best meets their needs
										  or budgets. Usually, this is a choice of an HMO and PPO, or HMO and POS. The
										  employer will typically pay a portion of the premium in these plans, and the
										  employee will pay the balance. Here are a few approaches: </p>
										<ul>
										  <li>An employer may pay for the lower cost plan and employees may buy up to
											the more expensive plan. </li>
										  <li>An employer may pay a set amount per month for every employee. </li>

										  has been stabilized, you would be transferred to a participating plan hospital.</p>
										<p><span class="term">emergency-room visit</span></p>
										   <p>A visit to a hospital for treatment of an accidental injury or for
										  emergency medical care. To qualify as an emergency, the symptoms must be sudden,
										  severe and require immediate medical attention. Some states judge emergencies
										  by the &quot;prudent layperson&quot; law, meaning that the health plan must
										  cover a trip to the emergency room &quot;if a prudent layperson, acting reasonably,
										  would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed.&quot; Keep
										  in mind that some plans won't cover a trip to the emergency room if the symptoms
										  appeared more than 24 hours earlier.</p>
										<p><span class="term">employee contribution </span></p>

										 <p>See &quot;short-term medical coverage.&quot;</p>
										<p><span class="term">formulary drugs </span></p>
										   <p>Formulary drugs generally have a lower copay. A formulary drug is
										  one that has been thoroughly reviewed by a team of expert pharmacists and physicians;
										  these drugs have been identified as safe, effective and beneficial to members
										  for treating medical conditions. When deciding between drugs which are equally
										  safe and effective, the formulary team also considers the relative costs of
										  medications. These savings are then passed on to you through lower premiums.</p>
										<p><span class="term">fully insured plan </span></p>

										  of making all claim payments.</p>
										<p><span class="term">fully self-insured plan </span></p>

										<h2 class="glossaryLetter">G</h2>
										<p><span class="term">gatekeeper </span></p>
										   <p>A term used to describe the primary care physician's role in a managed
										  care plan; this role is to authorize all services delivered to the insured
										  by other physicians or health care providers. Thus, whenever you wish to see
										  a physician other than your primary care physician, you must first obtain his
										  or her permission (via a referral).</p>
										<p><span class="term">generic (medications) </span></p>
										   <p>When a new drug is put on the market, the pharmaceutical company patents
										  it under a brand name. The company has the exclusive right to sell the drug
										  under this name, but once its patent expires, other companies can sell the
										  same drug under its chemical, or generic, name. Generic drugs are typically
										  cheaper than brand-name drugs, but the Food and Drug Administration requires
										  generic drug manufacturers to show that a generic drug &quot;delivers the same
										  amount of active ingredient in the same time frame as the original product.&quot;</p>
										<p><span class="term">group term life </span></p>
										   <p>A life-insurance plan that provides employees with additional coverage
										  at economical group rates.</p>

										<p><span class="term">health care provider </span></p>
										   <p>A doctor, hospital, laboratory, nurse or anyone else who delivers

										<p><span class="term">health insurance </span></p>
										   <p>A type of insurance that provides protection against the risk of financial
										  loss resulting from the insured person's sickness, accidental injury or disability.</p>
										<p><a href="#HIPAA"></a><span class="term">health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (HIPAA) </span></p>
										   <p>Under this federal law (known as HIPAA), group health plans cannot
										  deny coverage based solely on an individual's health status. This law also gives
										  employees who change or lose their jobs better access to health coverage, guarantees
										  renewability and availability to certain employees and limits exclusions for
										  pre-existing conditions. For example, under this law, group health plans must
										  credit any employee the amount of time that they spent on any health plan prior
										  to the new plan, which is known as &quot;prior credible coverage.&quot; A pre-existing
										  condition will be covered without a waiting period when an employee joins a
										  new group plan if the employee has been insured for the previous 12 months
										  with credible health insurance, with no lapse in coverage of 63 days or more.
										  This means that if an employee has been insured for 12 months or more, the
										  employee will be able to go from one job to another and his or her pre-existing
										  coverage will remain intact&mdash;without additional waiting periods. However,
										  if an employee has a pre-existing condition and was not covered previously
										  for 12 months before joining a new plan, the longest the employee will have
										  to wait for their pre-existing coverage to be covered is 12 months.</p>
										<p><span class="term">health maintenance organization (HMO) </span></p>
										   <p>A health care financing and delivery system that provides comprehensive
										  health care for subscribing members in a particular geographic area using managed

										  their network, often going so far as to require you to choose a primary care
										  physician who directs most courses of your treatment.</p>
										<p><span class="term">home health care </span></p>
										   <p>Skilled medical care and other health care services that you receive
										  in your home for the treatment of an illness or injury. Some insurance plans
										  don't provide this kind of coverage, or provide it only for a limited amount
										  of time.</p>

									<p><span class="term">maternity coverage </span></p>
									   <p>Many individual plans and some small-group plans for groups of fewer

									<p><span class="term">mental health - outpatient </span></p>
									   <p>Outpatient mental health benefits are generally divided into two categories,
									  severe and non-severe health care. State laws vary widely on the degree to
									  which insurance companies must cover mental illness. Most plans do provide
									  some coverage, though there may be limitations such as the severity or nature
									  of the illness and the duration of care.</p>
									<p>msa&mdash;benefits </p>
									   <p>The newest choice in health insurance for the self-employed, Medical
									  Savings Accounts (MSAs) allow you to build up a tax-free savings account to
									  pay for routine medical expenses. </p>

									  <p>You build the account with tax-free dollars, and they remain tax-free while
									  your MSA is active. Your MSA is used in conjunction with a high-deductible
									  insurance policy.</p>
									   <p>
									  With the high-deductible insurance plan, the cost of an MSA can be kept competitively
									  low. Tax-free dollars and an affordable price save you money. </p>

									<p><span class="term">severe mental health </span></p>
									   <p>As defined by the American Psychiatric Association in their Diagnostic
									  and Statistical Manual (DSM), severe mental illness includes the following
									  disorders: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
									  illness), major depressive disorders, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
									  disorder, pervasive developmental disorder or autism, anorexia nervosa and
									  bulimia nervosa. Such problems generally require at least occasional inpatient
									  care.</p>
									<p><span class="term">short-term disability </span></p>
									  <p>This type of coverage pays a percentage of your salary if you become
									  temporarily disabled, meaning that you are not able to work for a short period
									  of time due to sickness or injury (excluding on-the-job injuries, which are
									  covered by workers compensation). The per-week amount is usually 50, 60 or
									  66 2/3 percent of your weekly salary, and lasts for a period of time specified
									  by the plan.</p>
									<p><span class="term">short-term medical coverage </span></p>
									  <p>Similar to flex-term medical coverage. Short-term medical coverage
									  is a major medical plan designed to protect you in the event of an illness
									  or injury during &quot;gaps&quot; in your traditional medical coverage&mdash;when
									  you are between jobs or plans, a recent graduate, on strike, etc. Short-term
									  plans are not meant to cover routine exams and preventive care; if you are
									  looking for a choice of plan types and the ability to renew your plan beyond
									  one year, a traditional medical plan, while typically more expensive, may be
									  a better fit for your health insurance needs.</p>

									  number codes that attempts to classify all business establishments by the types
									  of products or services they make available. Establishments engaged in the
									  same activity, whatever their size or type of ownership, are assigned the same
									  SIC code. These definitions are important for standardization. Insurance companies
									  use SIC codes to determine specific rates for various industries. HealthInsurance.com
									  uses these codes to ensure that you receive the best possible rate for your
									  occupation.</p>
									<p><span class="term">standard risk rate </span></p>
									   <p>The risk category that is composed of proposed insureds who have a
									  likelihood of loss that is not significantly greater than average.</p>
									<p><span class="term">stop-loss provision </span></p>
									   <p>A major medical policy provision under which the insurer will pay
									  100 percent of the insured's eligible medical expenses after the insured has
									  incurred a specified amount of out-of-pocket expenses in deductible and coinsurance
									  payments.</p>
