                <div><a href='javascript:void(0)' class='question'>If I'm eligible for a premium tax credit to help pay for coverage on the Exchange, how does that work?</a></div>
                <div class='answer'> 
                 You can either have the credit used to lower your monthly premium cost, or you can pay the full premium cost and claim the credit on your tax return. Avoid an unexpected expense at tax time and report any changes in your financial situation after you enroll in the Exchange coverage. Changes in income or family size can change your premium tax credit throughout the year.

                <div><a href='javascript:void(0)' class='question'>Isn't there a catastrophic plan offered through the Exchange?</a></div>
                <div class='answer'> 
                Yes, there is a catastrophic plan for individuals up to 30 years old or those who have qualified for a hardship exemption. You cannot get a premium tax credit with a catastrophic plan. You must pay the standard price. While this plan may have lower premiums with some included services, there is a typically high deductible that has to be met before the plan helps cover healthcare costs.

                <div><a href='javascript:void(0)' class='question'>Maybe I can qualify for Medicaid?</a></div>
                <div class='answer'> 
                 You may qualify, but eligibility varies by state. Go to www.medicaid.gov to determine if you may be eligible.
<br \/>If you experience any changes in income or family size, report them to the Marketplace when they happen. This will help ensure you're getting the proper amount of financial assistance, and help avoid a surprise at the end of the year when you file your taxes. If the estimated amount of credit was too high, you'll have to pay the difference back to the IRS.
