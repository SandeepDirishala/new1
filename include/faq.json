If you've downloaded the UHCSR app, you can locate that provider even easier!" , "link":"#Q3-question" , "id":"Q3-question" },

{ "question": "I'm going to school out of state. Can I buy health insurance from that state's Exchange?",

   "answer":  "You can purchase a plan on the Exchanges, but you are not eligible for a premium tax credit to help pay for that plan." },

{ "question": "Is the student insurance plan from my school really a good alternative to a State or Federal Exchange plan?", 
   "answer":" Actually, your school's plan may suit your needs better. Some of that is based on underwriting rules and how premium rates are developed for a younger, healthier population of college students who need coverage for a limited time (while they are in school). Student insurance premium is usually lower than comparable Exchange plans as a result. And, because student insurance plans are built to serve the unique needs of schools and their students, UnitedHealthcare StudentResources student insurance plans can offer benefits not found in Exchange plans:\r\n<ul><li>If the school has a Student Health Center, we will likely treat it like a preferred provider in our network.<\/li><li>Our student plans have a national network of preferred providers backed by UnitedHealthcare. That means whether you're at school, at home, or enjoying spring break, we've got you covered.<\/li><li>Most of our student plans include global emergency services from UnitedHealthcare Global; great for when you're traveling or studying abroad.<\/li><li>Our plans typically offer lower deductibles, copayments, out-of-pocket maximums, and premiums than the lower cost options (Bronze, Silver, and Catastrophic) offered through the Marketplaces.<\/li><li>Your school-sponsored plan from UHCSR meets the Individual Mandate requirement of Minimum Essential Coverage.<\/li><li>With the school-sponsored student health insurance plan, the plan period is based on the school's academic year, not the calendar year like Marketplace plans. This means you can have coverage from the first day of school in the fall instead of waiting until a January 1 effective date.<\/li><li>Whether you're attending an in-state or an out-of-state school, you can purchase the school-sponsored plan. With the Marketplace, you can only purchase plans on your state's Marketplace.<\/li><li>For students attending an out-of-state school, those on a Marketplace plan may only be able to get non-emergency care within their Preferred Provider Network, which is often regional.<\/li><li>Depending on the school, you may be able to use financial aid to purchase the school-sponsored student health insurance plan<\/li><\/ul>" },   

{ "question":"I need dental and vision services. Are they covered under my plan?", 
   "answer": "ACA rules require us to include pediatric dental and vision coverage for insureds up to age 19. Some schools also offer a voluntary dental and/or vision plan. Check your school's student insurance page to see if dental and/or vision insurance is available through your school's student insurance program. These plans have only one 12 month coverage period. " },

{ "question": "Can I get health insurance from a Marketplace even if my school offers a student insurance plan?", 
   "answer" : "Yes, but make sure to do your homework (pun intended) before making a decision. From our experience, your school sponsored student insurance plan may be better. For Marketplace plans consider:\r\n<ul><li>Is the Student Health Center a preferred provider under the Marketplace plan?<\/li><li>Are services other than emergencies covered where you'll be attending school?<\/li><li>Are there in-network providers available across the nation (so you're covered at school, at home, and even when you're travelling)?<\/li><li>Does it offer Global Emergency Services when you're abroad?<\/li><li>Does the plan have pre-certification or pre-authorization requirements, or does it require a referral from your Primary Care Physician?<\/li><li>Don't forget to look at other costs like deductibles, copays, and total out-of-pocket cost, too.<\/li><\/ul>" },   

{ "question": "Can my school require students to have health insurance?", 
   "answer":  "Absolutely! Typically, this requirement can be met by enrolling in the school-sponsored student health insurance plan, or completing a waiver form showing proof of comparable coverage." },
   
{ "question":"Am I eligible for a premium tax credit, or subsidy, if I buy health insurance through the Marketplaces?", 
   "answer":"Maybe; here are the requirements according to the IRS:<br /><ul><li>You are not eligible for coverage through an employer or a government plan.<\/li><li>You fall within certain income limits.<\/li><li>You cannot be claimed as a dependent by another person.<\/li><li>You don't file a Married Filing Separately tax return (unless you meet the criteria related to victims of domestic abuse and spousal abandonment).<\/li><li>To determine your eligibility for a premium tax credit, go to <a href='http:\/\/HealthCare.gov'>www.HealthCare.gov<\/a> or call <a href='tel:800-318-2596'> 800-318-2596<\/a> .<\/li><\/ul>" },   

{ "h2":"State and Federal Exchanges" , "id":"hdr5"},

{ "question":"Do the State or Federal plans have an open enrollment period like student insurance plans?", 
   "answer":"Absolutely! The open enrollment period is based on a calendar year (January to December) versus an academic year (August - July). You can check for the next open enrollment period at <a target='_new' href='http:\/\/HealthCare.gov'>www.HealthCare.gov<\/a>.\r\n Just like most student insurance plans, State and Federal plans may allow for enrollment outside of the open enrollment period if you have a Qualifying Life Event. Call <a href='tel:800-318-2596'>800-318-2596<\/a> for assistance with the list of Qualifying Life Events." },

{ "question":"If I'm eligible for a premium tax credit to help pay for coverage on the Exchange, how does that work?", 
   "answer": "You can either have the credit used to lower your monthly premium cost, or you can pay the full premium cost and claim the credit on your tax return. Avoid an unexpected expense at tax time and report any changes in your financial situation after you enroll in the Exchange coverage. Changes in income or family size can change your premium tax credit throughout the year." },   

{ "question": "Isn't there a catastrophic plan offered through the Exchange?", 
   "answer":  "Yes, there is a catastrophic plan for individuals up to 30 years old or those who have qualified for a hardship exemption. You cannot get a premium tax credit with a catastrophic plan. You must pay the standard price. While this plan may have lower premiums with some included services, there is a typically high deductible that has to be met before the plan helps cover healthcare costs." },

{ "question":"Maybe I can qualify for Medicaid?", 
   "answer": "You may qualify, but eligibility varies by state. Go to <a href='http:\/\/medicaid.gov' >www.medicaid.gov<\/a> to determine if you may be eligible.<br \/><br \/>If you experience any changes in income or family size, report them to the Marketplace when they happen. This will help ensure you're getting the proper amount of financial assistance, and help avoid a surprise at the end of the year when you file your taxes. If the estimated amount of credit was too high, you'll have to pay the difference back to the IRS." }
